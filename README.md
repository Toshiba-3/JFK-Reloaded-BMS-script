# JFK-Reloaded-BMS-script
A simple QuickBMS script to extract the game contents

JFK Reloaded stores its resources in a .wad file named core000.wad. This is Stainless Games' format as used in other games like London Racer: Destruction Madness, Carmageddon Funsize, etc. However the format was slightly different so I modified the previous London Racer bms script to make it work with this game.
